# 14. Deployment and Distribution

This section covers strategies for deploying and distributing your React Native OBD-II application to users.

## Building for Production

Before distributing your application, you need to prepare it for production deployment.

### Android Production Build

To build your Android application for production:

1. **Update Version Information**:
   
   In `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   android {
       defaultConfig {
           applicationId "com.yourdomain.obdapp"
           versionCode 1
           versionName "1.0.0"
           // ...
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Generate a Signing Key**:
   ```bash
   keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```

3. **Configure Signing in Gradle**:
   
   Create `android/app/gradle.properties` (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
   MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
   MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
   MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
   ```

   Update `android/app/build.gradle`:
   ```gradle
   android {
       // ...
       signingConfigs {
           release {
               storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
               storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
               keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
               keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
           }
       }
       buildTypes {
           release {
               signingConfig signingConfigs.release
               // ...
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Build Release APK**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

5. **Test the Release Build**:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android --variant=release
   ```
