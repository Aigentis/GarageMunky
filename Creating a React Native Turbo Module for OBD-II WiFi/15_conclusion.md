As you complete your initial implementation, consider these potential enhancements:

1. **Expanded Vehicle Coverage**:
   - Support for manufacturer-specific PIDs
   - Enhanced compatibility with hybrid and electric vehicles
   - Support for CAN bus monitoring beyond standard OBD-II

2. **Advanced AI Features**:
   - Predictive maintenance alerts
   - Personalized driving efficiency recommendations
   - Integration with vehicle service history

3. **Community Features**:
   - Crowdsourced vehicle compatibility database
   - Shared diagnostic experiences
   - Expert mechanic marketplace integration

4. **Hardware Expansion**:
   - Support for additional OBD-II adapter types (Bluetooth, USB)
   - Integration with external sensors
   - Support for multiple simultaneous vehicle connections

5. **Integration Possibilities**:
   - Navigation app integration for trip logging
   - Fuel price integration for cost analysis
   - Insurance telematics integration
