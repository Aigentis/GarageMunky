# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Prevalidation:** Check if the current directory is already a project (e.g., verify existence of package.json or an existing project structure) to avoid re-initialization. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, implementation_plan)*
2.  **Node.js & Tool Check:** Verify that Node.js v20.2.1 is installed since it is required for React Native development. If not, install Node.js v20.2.1 and verify with `node -v`. *(Reference: tech_stack_document, implementation_plan)*
3.  **Project Initialization:** If the project is not initialized, run the React Native CLI to create a new React Native project with TypeScript support. For example:

`npx react-native init GarageMunky --template react-native-template-typescript`

*(Reference: frontend_guidelines_document, implementation_plan)*

1.  **Directory Setup:** Create necessary directories:

    *   Create a `/src` folder to contain the app components and screens.
    *   Inside `/src`, create subdirectories: `/components`, `/screens`, and `/services`. *(Reference: frontend_guidelines_document, implementation_plan)*

2.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file at the project root to store configuration for external services such as Appwrite endpoint, UK GOV API keys, Stripe secret/public keys, Twilio API keys, Google Maps API key, and OpenAI API token. *(Reference: backend_structure_document, security_guideline_document)* Example .env content:

`APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-server.com/v1 APPWRITE_PROJECT=your-appwrite-project-id UKGOV_API_KEY=your-ukgov-api-key STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-stripe-public-key STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key TWILIO_API_KEY=your-twilio-api-key GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key`

1.  **Tool Configuration for Windsurf:** Since the team will eventually migrate to Windsurf (finalization assistant), check if your Windsurf IDE environment is set up. If not, open the Cascade assistant in Windsurf, tap on the hammer (MCP) icon, and configure as needed. *(Reference: windsurf_file, implementation_plan)*

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Navigation Setup:** Create a navigation structure (using a library like React Navigation) to handle the distinct user flows for Car Owners, Garage Operators, and Admins. Create a file at `/src/navigation/AppNavigation.tsx`. *(Reference: app_flow_document, frontend_guidelines_document)*
2.  **Authentication Screens:** Implement the sign-up/login screens with support for OAuth via Google, Apple, and email. Create a new file at `/src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx`. Use Appwrite's authentication methods for integration. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, frontend_guidelines_document)*
3.  **Dashboard for Car Owners:** Create a dashboard screen for Car Owners that displays vehicle data (MOT status, tax status, registration number, etc.). Create `/src/screens/CarOwnerDashboard.tsx`. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, app_flow_document)*
4.  **Dashboard for Garage Operators:** Create a dashboard for Garage Operators at `/src/screens/GarageDashboard.tsx` to manage appointments, communications, and operational analytics. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, app_flow_document)*
5.  **Admin Dashboard:** Create an Admin Dashboard screen (`/src/screens/AdminDashboard.tsx`) to monitor app performance, user engagement, and error tracking. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, app_flow_document)*
6.  **AI-Powered Booking Assistant UI:** Develop a booking screen (`/src/screens/BookingScreen.tsx`) that integrates an AI-powered predictive booking assistant. Include UI elements for service type, dates/times, and a slot suggestion display panel. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, app_flow_document)*
7.  **GPT-Powered Diagnostic Tool UI:** Implement a diagnostic tool screen at `/src/screens/DiagnosticToolScreen.tsx` with a text input for user-provided symptoms/issues and a display area for GPT-powered responses. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, app_flow_document)*
8.  **Garage Locator Screen:** Integrate Google Maps into a garage locator screen; create `/src/screens/GarageLocatorScreen.tsx` and include map components styled with Tailwind CSS (using a React Native Tailwind integration). *(Reference: project_requirements_document, frontend_guidelines_document)*
9.  **Payments Screen:** Build a secure payments component to handle Stripe transactions on the booking screen. Create a component at `/src/components/StripePayment.tsx` and integrate it with the booking flow. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, security_guideline_document)*
10. **Messaging UI:** Develop a messaging interface that supports appointment reminders, confirmations, alerts, and allows user configuration for channels (WhatsApp via official API and fallback to Twilio SMS). Create `/src/screens/CommunicationCenter.tsx`. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, app_flow_document)*
11. **UI Styling:** Apply the UK transport-inspired color palette and modern, engaging design using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components. Ensure that load times are under 3 seconds. *(Reference: frontend_guidelines_document, project_requirements_document)*
12. **Frontend Validation:** Test the UI components using a device simulator (or Expo if applicable) and run unit tests for each component (e.g., using Jest and React Native Testing Library). *(Reference: frontend_guidelines_document)*

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  **Appwrite Server Setup:** Set up your Appwrite server if not already available. Follow the official Appwrite docs to configure the server and create a project for GarageMunky. *(Reference: backend_structure_document, project_requirements_document)*

2.  **Database Schema Creation:** In the Appwrite console, create the following collections:

    *   Users: With fields for name, email, role (car_owner, garage_owner, admin), and OAuth provider data.
    *   Vehicles: Fields for MOT status & expiry, tax status & expiry, registration number, vehicle make/model, insurance status, last MOT result, emissions data, and mileage record.
    *   Appointments: Fields for booking details, appointment time slots, and service type.
    *   Communications: For logs of messaging interactions. *(Reference: backend_structure_document, project_requirements_document)*

3.  **Backend Functions & API Endpoints:** Create Appwrite functions or cloud code to handle:

    *   Real-time vehicle data integration with UK GOV APIs (ensure appropriate API token use).
    *   AI-powered booking suggestions: Integrate with OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo to generate appointment recommendations.
    *   Diagnostic assistant: Process user descriptions and return possible troubleshooting tips using GPT-4 Turbo.
    *   Payment processing: Secure Stripe integration for handling payments, ensuring PCI DSS compliance.
    *   Messaging: Integrate WhatsApp API (with fallback to Twilio SMS) for notifications and communication. *(Reference: backend_structure_document, project_requirements_document)*

4.  **Backend Validation:** Use Appwriteâ€™s built-in testing tools or external API testing software (e.g., Postman) to call the endpoints and verify expected responses (e.g., a GET on the Vehicles collection, a POST to the booking function). *(Reference: backend_structure_document, security_guideline_document)*

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Frontend-Backend Connection:** In the React Native app, integrate the Appwrite SDK by installing the Appwrite package and configuring it to point to your Appwrite server (using details from the .env file). Modify `/src/services/appwriteClient.ts` accordingly. *(Reference: backend_structure_document, project_requirements_document)*
2.  **Role-based Authentication:** Ensure that the OAuth and email authentication methods correctly assign user roles (car_owner, garage_owner, admin) upon registration/login and that the app UI adjusts accordingly. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, security_guideline_document)*
3.  **API Integration for Vehicle Data:** Connect the vehicle data dashboard to the Appwrite functions that pull real-time data from UK GOV APIs. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, backend_structure_document)*
4.  **Integration for AI Features:** Link the booking assistant and diagnostic tool UI components with their respective backend functions using appropriate API calls managed by the Appwrite SDK. *(Reference: project_requirements_document, backend_structure_document)*
