# GarageMunky Security Guidelines Document

This document outlines the essential security principles and requirements for GarageMunky. Our approach is built on a foundation of secure coding practices and defense-in-depth. The guidelines below ensure that security is embedded throughout the entire development lifecycle.

## 1. Security Philosophy

*   **Security by Design:**

    *   Embed security from the requirements phase through design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
    *   Treat all external inputs as untrusted, applying rigorous validation and sanitization.

*   **Least Privilege:**

    *   Grant only the necessary permissions to components, users, and services to perform their intended functions.

*   **Defense in Depth:**

    *   Implement multiple layers of security controls (e.g., authentication, authorization, encryption, and logging) so that the compromise of one control does not expose the entire system.

*   **Secure Defaults & Fail Securely:**

    *   Ensure that all configurations and code operate in the most secure mode by default.
    *   In case of failures, ensure sensitive information is not exposed and the system remains protected.

## 2. Authentication and Access Control

*   **Robust Authentication:**

    *   OAuth integration for Google, Apple, and email sign-in with secure session management.
    *   Implement strong password policies and use state-of-the-art password hashing (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) with unique salts.

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

    *   Differentiate the privileges between Car Owners and Garage Operators.
    *   Ensure that every endpoint and API call strictly validates user roles and permissions server-side before executing sensitive operations.

*   **Session Security:**

    *   Use unpredictable session identifiers with robust transport security (TLS 1.2+).
    *   Enforce session timeouts and secure cookie attributes such as HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite.

## 3. Input Handling & Data Validation

*   **Prevent Injection Attacks:**

    *   Use parameterized queries and modern ORM frameworks to prevent SQL (and NoSQL) injection.
    *   Sanitize command and file inputs to avoid command injection and path traversal attacks.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Mitigation:**

    *   Apply context-aware output encoding for user-supplied data.
    *   Implement Content Security Policies (CSP) and sanitize HTML inputs.

*   **Server-side Validation Only:**

    *   Rely on server-side validation as the primary defense against malformed or malicious user inputs.

## 4. Data Protection and Privacy

*   **Encryption:**

    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (using protocols like TLS 1.2+ and AES-256).
    *   Ensure PCI DSS compliance for payment processing with Stripe.

*   **Secret Management:**

    *   Do not hardcode credentials or API keys in source code. Use secrets management tools (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

*   **Data Minimization:**

    *   Display only essential vehicle data (such as MOT status, tax information, registration number, and vehicle make/model).
    *   Mask or anonymize sensitive data where possible to reduce risk exposure.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Adhere to GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018.
    *   Implement audit logs and monitor system events to detect unwanted data access or anomalies.

## 5. API and Communication Security

*   **HTTPS Enforcement:**

    *   All API communications must be encrypted using TLS.

*   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:**

    *   Protect against abuse (e.g., brute-force attacks) by implementing rate limits on endpoints.

*   **CORS Configuration:**

    *   Strictly limit cross-origin resource sharing to trusted domains.

*   **Secure Messaging:**

    *   Integrate multi-channel messaging via WhatsApp and SMS (with Twilio as backup) with strict control over notification types and user preferences.

## 6. Infrastructure and Deployment

*   **Server Configuration:**

    *   Harden all server configurations, disable unused ports and services, and ensure secure file permissions.
    *   Regularly update system components and libraries to mitigate vulnerabilities.

*   **TLS/SSL Security:**

    *   Use up-to-date protocols and cipher suites; disable obsolete and insecure protocols.
    *   Employ HSTS to enforce secure connections.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Security:**

    *   Integrate software composition analysis and security scanning into your CI/CD pipelines to ensure dependencies are free from known vulnerabilities.

## 7. Mobile Application Specifics

*   **Data Security on Mobile:**

    *   Securely store sensitive data; avoid storing credentials or tokens in local, insecure storage locations like localStorage or plain text files.

*   **Code Obfuscation & Integrity:**

    *   Consider implementing native code obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering.
    *   Use appropriate mechanisms to check the integrity of the app at runtime.

## 8. Monitoring, Auditing, and Incident Response

*   **Logging:**

    *   Log authentication attempts, API calls, errors, and system events with no sensitive data exposed.
    *   Ensure logs are secured and regularly reviewed for anomalies.

*   **Incident Response:**

    *   Develop and maintain an incident response plan to quickly mitigate and recover from potential breaches or security events.
    *   Regularly review and test security policies and procedures.

## 9. Third-Party Integrations & Tools

*   **UK GOV APIs:**

    *   Validate all data fetched to ensure it is within expected formats and values.

*   **Stripe & Payment Processing:**

    *   Ensure secure embedding of Stripe elements and tokenization of payment details.
    *   Validate payment data on the server with PCI DSS compliance.

*   **Messaging (WhatsApp, Twilio):**

    *   Securely integrate messaging by handling API keys and tokens via secure secret management.

*   **Development Tools (Lovable, Windsurf):**

    *   Review and vet all generated code from automated tools to ensure they meet our strict security guidelines before integration.

## Conclusion

GarageMunky is built with a security-first mindset. The guidelines documented above must be followed at all stages of development to ensure a robust application that not only delivers seamless functionality to car owners and garage operators but also ensures that user data and transactions are secure and compliant with relevant regulations.

Staying updated with security best practices, continuous monitoring, and regular reviews of the app and its integrations will help keep GarageMunky resilient against evolving threats.

*This document will be updated periodically as new security threats are identified and emerging best practices are adopted within the industry.*
