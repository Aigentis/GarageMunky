# GarageMunky App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user discovers GarageMunky, they are first greeted with a modern, streamlined landing screen that clearly explains the value of the app and offers a simple call to action. New users can choose to sign up using one of several secure methods, including Google, Apple, or email. After selecting their preferred sign-up method, users are prompted to provide the necessary information and, importantly, choose their account type – either Car Owner or Garage Operator. This role selection guides the subsequent user experience with tailored features visible only to the chosen group. The authentication process also includes an option for password recovery in case users forget their details, ensuring that sign-in is both secure and user-friendly. Once registered, users can sign in with ease, and a prominent sign-out option is always available for safe account management.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, users are directed to the main dashboard which immediately reflects their role – Car Owner dashboards focus on personalized vehicle management while Garage Operator dashboards highlight operational tools. Car Owners see critical vehicle information such as MOT status, tax deadlines, registration details, and the latest maintenance data sourced from UK government APIs. This dashboard is designed with a clean, UK transport-inspired color palette and a clear layout that emphasizes easy navigation. Garage Operators, on the other hand, see an interface that organizes upcoming appointment bookings, service calendars, and communication threads. The unified design uses familiar navigation menus, headers, and icons that help users immediately understand where to find key actions like booking appointments or sending messages. This design ensures that regardless of role, users can easily move from the dashboard to other parts of the app.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

For Car Owners, the journey starts with a detailed vehicle dashboard. After reviewing essential vehicle data, users can tap on the AI-powered predictive booking assistant. This tool asks users to input a few details such as their preferred service type, available dates, and times. The assistant processes historical data and upcoming maintenance deadlines to provide optimal appointment recommendations. Once a user selects a recommended slot, the app seamlessly validates the garage’s availability in real time and transitions the user into a secure booking confirmation page. Here, payment details are entered via an integrated Stripe interface, ensuring that every transaction complies with PCI DSS standards. After confirming the booking, users are shown a confirmation page along with an option to view appointment details in a calendar format.

Another core feature is the GPT-powered diagnostic tool available within the Car Owner's flow. Users can access it through the dashboard whenever they notice issues with their vehicle. The tool engages in a conversational manner, asking questions about the symptoms, observed noises, and performance anomalies. As users provide feedback, the tool refines its suggestions and offers potential diagnoses or actionable tips. This dialog-based flow helps car owners decide whether they need to book a service appointment or simply follow recommended troubleshooting guidelines.

Garage Operators experience a different set of flows tailored to their role. After logging in, they are taken to a dashboard that shows upcoming appointments, a visual appointment calendar, and real-time booking management tools. Operators can click on each booking to view detailed customer information and any diagnostic insights that have been communicated by car owners. Enhanced messaging tools allow them to send priority alerts and confirm service details. This interface is connected to a separate premium messaging zone that ensures important communications are not missed, allowing garage operators to maintain seamless interactions with their clients.

In addition, all users have access to a comprehensive communication center where they can view notifications and messages. This section integrates messaging services via WhatsApp and SMS, ensuring that whether the user prefers one method over the other, they receive timely confirmations, reminders, and service alerts. Throughout the app, clear page transitions are established: users move logically between dashboards, booking pages, diagnostic tools, and communication centers, making the entire app experience intuitive and connected.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the settings section, users manage all aspects of their personal information and preferences. Here, users update details, manage account security, and adjust communication settings such as opting for WhatsApp, SMS, or email notifications for appointment reminders and service alerts. Car Owners can review their vehicle information and configure which updates they want to receive about MOT or tax deadlines, while Garage Operators can adjust calendar settings and notification priorities for incoming bookings. Payment methods and billing information, particularly for scheduling appointments through Stripe, are also managed in this section. Once changes are saved, users are smoothly transitioned back to their respective dashboards, ensuring that account management feels integrated with the overall app experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If users enter invalid data during sign up or booking, error messages are displayed clearly on the same page, instructing them on how to correct their input. For example, if a password is too weak or if required fields are missing, inline errors appear to guide the user. In scenarios where connectivity issues occur, the app displays a friendly fallback page with a retry option and advises the user of network problems. Similarly, if a user attempts to access a restricted feature based on their role (such as a car owner trying to access garage management tools), the app provides a clear message explaining the limitation and guiding them to the appropriate section. Payment failures are handled by immediately informing the user with error prompts and offering choices to retry or contact support. Similarly, if a messaging service encounters issues (like a failure to send SMS), the message is queued and the user is notified, ensuring that the flow remains uninterrupted despite errors.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

At its core, GarageMunky is designed to be a seamless experience from the moment a user signs up until they are engaged in daily vehicle management or booking maintenance services. Car Owners start by securely registering and logging in, selecting their role, and then exploring a personalized dashboard that provides real-time vehicle data and accessible booking tools powered by AI. They can quickly schedule appointments with recommendations based on their car’s maintenance history and confirm bookings through secure payments integrated with Stripe. Garage Operators enjoy a robust interface that organizes appointments, enables direct communication, and confirms bookings with ease. In addition, both types of users can manage their notifications and account settings, ensuring continuous control over their experience. The overall app journey is designed to eliminate confusion, reduce steps, and provide clear, user-friendly navigation that connects every feature, from onboarding and diagnostics to booking and communication.
