# GarageMunky Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices made for GarageMunky, our mobile application for streamlining vehicle management. Written in everyday language, it helps you understand how each piece fits into creating a smooth, secure, and efficient experience for both car owners and garage operators.

## Frontend Technologies

For the user interface, we chose technologies that make the app both attractive and responsive:

*   **React Native (TypeScript)**

    *   We use React Native to build a mobile application that works on different devices, ensuring a consistent experience on both iOS and Android.
    *   TypeScript adds extra checks that help us catch errors early, resulting in a more reliable app overall.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   Tailwind CSS helps us quickly style the app with pre-defined classes. This means we can create a clean, responsive design inspired by UK transport aesthetics with less hassle.

*   **Shadcn UI**

    *   Shadcn UI provides ready-made user interface components that are modern and visually appealing. This speeds up development and helps maintain a consistent design across screens.

These frontend tools work together to make sure that every user – whether a car owner or a garage operator – enjoys a smooth, modern, and easy-to-navigate app experience.

## Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, we use a set of technologies that manage data, handle security, and power intelligent features:

*   **Appwrite**

    *   Appwrite manages user authentication, database operations, and the administration dashboard. It helps us control who sees what and ensures data is safely stored and managed.

*   **UK GOV APIs**

    *   These APIs provide real-time, reliable vehicle data directly from government sources. This means users can trust the details such as MOT statuses, tax expiry dates, and other key information.

*   **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo**

    *   GPT-4 Turbo is used for two smart features: a GPT-powered diagnostic tool that helps users troubleshoot vehicle issues and an AI-powered predictive booking assistant, which guides users through scheduling repairs more efficiently.

*   **Stripe**

    *   Stripe processes payments securely and is fully compliant with PCI DSS standards. This ensures that every transaction is safe, building trust among users who make bookings and payments through the app.

*   **Google Maps**

    *   Google Maps integration allows users to easily locate nearby garages. It’s essential for a clear, visual representation of where services are available.

*   **WhatsApp & Twilio**

    *   WhatsApp is our primary channel for sending notifications and confirmations, while Twilio supports SMS communications as a backup. This guarantees that important messages, such as appointment reminders or alerts, reach our users reliably.

Each backend component is carefully selected to securely manage data, power AI features, and create a cohesive service that supports all of GarageMunky’s core functions.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Reliable, fast, and scalable infrastructure is key to our project:

*   **Hosting & Deployment Platforms**

    *   The app is hosted on cloud platforms that ensure high availability and rapid scaling. This minimizes downtime and makes sure the app loads quickly for every user.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines**

    *   Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are used to test and deploy new features efficiently. This protects the app from issues and ensures that updates can be rolled out smoothly.

*   **Version Control Systems**

    *   We use modern version control systems for managing code changes, ensuring all team members collaborate effectively while building and refining the app.

These tools make it easy for our team to deploy updates and keep the app running reliably as user needs change and new features are added.

## Third-Party Integrations

We integrated several third-party services to provide additional features and reliability:

*   **UK GOV APIs**

    *   These government-provided APIs deliver up-to-date vehicle data, a cornerstone of the app’s trust and accuracy.

*   **Stripe**

    *   Stripe securely handles every payment, giving our users a worry-free transactional experience.

*   **Google Maps**

    *   It helps users locate garages and visually understand service locations.

*   **WhatsApp & Twilio**

    *   Messaging through these services ensures that appointment reminders, alerts, and confirmations reach users promptly, even if one channel fails.

*   **OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo**

    *   Powers both the predictive booking assistant and diagnostic tool, creating a more interactive and intelligent experience for users.

Together, these integrations enhance the functionality of GarageMunky, ensuring that data flows smoothly between services and that every interaction is meaningful and secure.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are at the core of GarageMunky:

*   **Security Measures:**

    *   **Authentication via OAuth:** Users can sign in using trusted providers such as Google or Apple, which simplifies access and boosts security.
    *   **Data Protection:** Compliance with GDPR, the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and PCI DSS for payment security ensures personal and payment data remain fully secure.
    *   **Regular Updates:** We continuously update security protocols to protect data from breaches and to keep our infrastructure secure.

*   **Performance Optimizations:**

    *   The app is designed for rapid load times (under 3 seconds) to provide a smooth experience, especially important on mobile devices.
    *   Efficient API calls and caching strategies keep app responses quick and dependable.

By focusing on these strategies, we ensure that GarageMunky not only fulfills its functions efficiently but also remains secure and trustworthy for every user.
