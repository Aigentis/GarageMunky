# Project Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks the progress of the GarageMunky project based on the `implementation_plan.md` and the current state of the web-based codebase (Vite + React + TypeScript).

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

-   [x] **Prevalidation:** Project exists (`package.json` found). *(Based on file check)*
-   [x] **Node.js & Tool Check:** Node.js v20.14.0 found (compatible with v20.2.1 requirement). *(Based on `node -v`)*
-   [x] **Project Initialization:** Project initialized with Vite + React + TypeScript. *(Deviation: Web stack instead of React Native)*
-   [x] **Directory Setup:**
    -   [x] `/src` folder exists.
    -   [x] `/src/components` exists.
    -   [x] `/src/screens` (mapped to `/src/pages`) exists.
    -   [x] `/src/services` exists.
-   [ ] **Environment Variables:** `.env` file needs creation and population with API keys/endpoints (Appwrite, UK GOV, Stripe, Twilio, Google Maps, OpenAI).
-   [x] **Tool Configuration for Windsurf:** `.windsurfrules` exists. *(Assumed user has configured IDE)*

## Phase 2: Frontend Development (Web Adaptation)

-   [ ] **Navigation Setup:** Basic routing likely present in `src/App.tsx` using `react-router-dom`, but needs refinement for role-based flows (Car Owners, Garage Operators, Admins). A dedicated `/src/navigation` structure might still be beneficial.
-   [x] **Authentication Screens:** `src/pages/Onboarding.tsx` exists, likely handles sign-up/login UI. Needs backend integration (Appwrite).
-   [x] **Dashboard for Car Owners:** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` exists. Needs specific content for car owners and vehicle data integration.
-   [x] **Dashboard for Garage Operators:** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` exists. Needs specific content for garage operators (appointments, communications, analytics).
-   [ ] **Admin Dashboard:** No specific `AdminDashboard.tsx` found. Needs creation and integration with backend (likely Appwrite).
-   [x] **AI-Powered Booking Assistant UI:** `src/pages/NewBooking.tsx` exists, potentially covers this UI. Needs AI backend integration.
-   [x] **GPT-Powered Diagnostic Tool UI:** `src/pages/Diagnostic.tsx` exists. Needs GPT backend integration.
-   [x] **Vehicle Data Display Components:** `src/components/VehicleCard.tsx`, `src/components/VehicleDetailsList.tsx`, `src/pages/VehicleDetails.tsx`, `src/pages/VehiclesList.tsx` exist. Needs real-time UK GOV API integration.
-   [x] **Appointment Management UI:** `src/pages/NewBooking.tsx`, `src/pages/BookingDetails.tsx`, `src/pages/BookingsList.tsx` exist. Needs backend integration.
-   [ ] **Communication Center UI:** No specific component found. Needs creation for messaging features.
-   [x] **Payment Processing UI:** Likely needs components added. Stripe integration required. *(Assumption: Current pages don't have payment UI)*
-   [x] **Mapping UI:** `src/components/GarageMap.tsx`, `src/components/GarageMapView.tsx`, `src/pages/GarageLocations.tsx` exist. Needs Google Maps API key integration.
-   [x] **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI are set up (`tailwind.config.ts`, `src/components/ui`). Mobile responsiveness needs ongoing refinement.

## Phase 3: Backend Development (Appwrite Focus)

-   [ ] **Appwrite Setup:** Instance setup, project creation, and API key generation.
-   [ ] **Database Schema:** Define and create Appwrite collections (Users, Vehicles, Garages, Appointments, Communications).
-   [ ] **Backend Functions & API Endpoints (Appwrite Cloud Functions):**
    -   [ ] Real-time vehicle data integration (UK GOV APIs).
    -   [ ] AI-powered booking logic (using OpenAI).
    -   [ ] GPT-powered diagnostic logic (using OpenAI).
    -   [ ] Secure payment processing (Stripe integration).
    -   [ ] Messaging integration (WhatsApp/Twilio).
-   [ ] **Backend Validation:** Testing Appwrite endpoints and functions.

## Phase 4: Integration

-   [ ] **Frontend-Backend Connection:** Integrate Appwrite SDK (`/src/services/appwriteClient.ts` needs creation/update). Use `.env` variables.
-   [ ] **Role-based Authentication:** Connect frontend auth UI (`Onboarding.tsx`) to Appwrite auth, implement role handling.
-   [ ] **API Integration for Vehicle Data:** Connect dashboard/vehicle components to Appwrite functions fetching UK GOV data.
-   [ ] **Integration for AI Features:** Connect booking/diagnostic UIs to respective Appwrite backend functions.
-   [ ] **Payments Integration:** Connect payment UI to Stripe backend functions via Appwrite.
-   [ ] **Messaging Integration:** Connect Communication Center UI to WhatsApp/Twilio backend functions.
-   [ ] **Integration Validation:** End-to-end testing of key user flows.

## Phase 5: Deployment & PWA Features

-   [ ] **Appwrite and Backend Deployment:** Deploy Appwrite instance and functions.
-   [ ] **Frontend Deployment:** Configure build process for web deployment (e.g., using Vercel, Netlify).
-   [ ] **PWA Setup:**
    -   [ ] Create `manifest.json`.
    -   [ ] Implement Service Worker for offline capabilities/caching.
    -   [ ] Configure web push notifications.
-   [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Automate testing and deployment.
-   [ ] **Compliance Checks:** Final validation of security, GDPR, etc.
-   [ ] **Final System Validation:** Comprehensive end-to-end testing.
-   [ ] **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools.
